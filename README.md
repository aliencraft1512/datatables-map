This works, but it is a work in progress. Some CSS issues and other optimizations and redudancies to be solved.

The objective is to have a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> map that, when clicked will trigger a side moving pane (`div`) that will show an HTML file generated (completely or partially) through <a href="http://datatables.net/">Datatables</a>.

It is based on <a href="https://github.com/Jumagreens/AfyaMap">AfyaMap</a>.

A working example is available at <a href="http://educacaoaberta.org/leaflet">educacaoaberta.org/leaflet</a>.
