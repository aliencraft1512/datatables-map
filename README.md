It is a data navigation tool based on a <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> map. When POIs are triggered a moving pane shows up that will show an HTML file generated (completely or partially) through <a href="http://datatables.net/">Datatables</a>. 

Datatables provides a responsive, searchable and sortable table.

It is based on <a href="https://github.com/Jumagreens/AfyaMap">AfyaMap</a>. It includes libraries for Leaflet search and finding your location. 

A working example is available at <a href="http://educacaoaberta.org/leaflet">educacaoaberta.org/leaflet</a>.
